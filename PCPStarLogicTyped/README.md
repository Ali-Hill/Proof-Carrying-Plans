$PCP^*$ Logic

This inference system is a version of PCP $PCP^*$ Logic that can be used with *typed* PDDL Domains. 

All of the generic files that can be used for all supported PDDL domains can be found in the src folder. 

Examples
---------

Inside the test folder the taxi domain is defined along with an example derivation using the typing relation.

Also inside the test folder are the *Fuel* and *Fairness* running examples that are used in the thesis.
